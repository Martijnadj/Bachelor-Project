# Bachelor-Project
This repository will contain all relevant code used in my bachelor thesis

The code in the folder LOCO-EFA is based upon the code from the article:
Y. E. Sanchez-Corrales, M. Hartley, J. van Rooij, A. F. M. Maree, and V.  A.  Grieneisen,
Morphometrics  of  complex  cell  shapes:  lobe  contribution elliptic Fourier analysis (LOCO-EFA), 
Development 145, dev156778 (2018).

The code in the folder 'Tissue Simulation Toolkit' is based upon version 0.1.4.3 of Tissue Simulation Toolkit:
 R. M. H. Merks and J. A. Glazier,
A cell-centered approach to developmental biology,  
Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications 352, 113 (2005).

The latest unedited version of the code can be found online easily. 
An explanation on the usage and installation of Tissue Simulation can be found in the book Vascular Morphogenesis:
J. T. Daub and R. M. Merks, Cell-Based Computational Modeling of Vascular Morphogenesis Using Tissue Simulation Toolkit, in
Vascular Morphogenesis - Methods and Protocols, edited by D. Ribatti, chapter 6, pages67–128, Bari, 2015
