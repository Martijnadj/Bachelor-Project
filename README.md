# Bachelor-Project
This repository will contain all relevant code used in my bachelor thesis

The code in the folder 'Extracting outlines in vitro gastruloids' is based upon code written by Maria Mircea.

The code in the folder LOCO-EFA is based upon the code from the article:
Y. E. Sanchez-Corrales, M. Hartley, J. van Rooij, A. F. M. Maree, and V.  A.  Grieneisen,
Morphometrics  of  complex  cell  shapes:  lobe  contribution elliptic Fourier analysis (LOCO-EFA), 
Development 145, dev156778 (2018).

The code in the folder 'Tissue Simulation Toolkit' is based upon version 0.1.4.3 of Tissue Simulation Toolkit:
 R. M. H. Merks and J. A. Glazier,
A cell-centered approach to developmental biology,  
Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications 352, 113 (2005).

The latest unedited version of the code can be found online easily. 
To run this, one needs to install Qt at https://www.qt.io/download. 
Then, one should enter the subsequent commands in a terminal in order to get simulations running: 
>> qmake
>> make
>> ./ce default.par
